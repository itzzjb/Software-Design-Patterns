# Software Design Patterns 

### What is design patterns ?
- We are solving the same kinds of problems again and again when building different kinds of software.
- People saw some patterns and ways of solving problems.
- There were 4 people who got together ( gang of 4 ) and they started documenting solutions for these kind of problems.
- So, other people does't want to reinvent the wheel again and again to solve these problems.

- We are gonna learn about Object Oriented Design Patterns here. ( Gang Of 4 design patterns are Object Oriented Design Patterns )

### Advantages of using Design Patterns
- No need to re-invent the wheel to solve problems
- It will increase the quality of work ( Because these patterns are already proven by other developers )
- Helps to reduce the number of bugs
- Helps to come up with a good code structure ( Good class hierarchy )
- Extensibility of the code will be increased ( Easy to add / plugin new requirements to the system without breaking other systems )
- There are industry specific we use in companies. So using Design pattens will help us to communicate with other developers easily.
  ex -> "I used observer pattern to build this code."

### Mistakes when using Design Patterns
- Using the wrong design pattern
- Using a design pattern where it is inapplicable
  ex -> When you are building a simple solution, which you are not maintain for a long time. (One time thing) For those type of scenarios we don't need design patterns.

### How to avoid these mistakes ?
- Have a proper understanding before using them and it's use cases
- Having peer reviews (It is recommended in the industry get your code reviewed by a colleagues / seniors of a team members when you write a code )

### Design patterns we gonna learn here... (There are much more too)
- Singleton Design Pattern
- Factory Design Pattern
- Decorator Design Pattern
- Observer Design Pattern
- Adaptor Design Pattern
